=== What's this? ===

Delayed Job Admin provides a handy little interface to help with debugging failed jobs created by the delayed_job plugin. Explore /examples for more details.

=== Requirements ===

 Supports Safari 3 and Firefox 3.5
 Requires jQuery 1.3.2 for JavaScript behavior
 CSS assumes a reasonable default style (e.g. Yahoo's reset.css)

=== Installation ===

script/plugin install git://github.com/eac/delayed_job_admin.git

rake delayed_job_admin:copy_assets

Ensure the style is included in your layout:
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag    'delayed_job_admin' %>
  
Before the </body> tag in your layout, add:
  <%= yield :javascript %>  

=== Usage ===

Access via delayed_jobs_path at /delayed_jobs, or define a custom route, example:
map.namespace :admin do |admin|
  admin.resources :jobs, :namespace => nil, :controller => 'delayed_jobs'
end

=== Security ===

By default job management is publicly accessible, to inherit from a controller that restricts public access, create lib/delayed_job_admin/config.rb:
module DelayedAdmin
  module Config
  
    def self.parent_controller_class
      YourSecureController
    end
    
  end
end
